 * This part of our project will act as a seive.
 * By seive I mean that this layer is where the information coming in from the user 
 * gets checked. 
 * It is where all the business logic happens 
 * Stops the user from directly interaction with the database
 * Only allows information to be added to the database, once it meets our requirements
 * 
 * 
 * We need to see this from a business perspective.
 * When the user is typing in information and saving it, what requirements do we need from user.
 * Is the information inputted, correct? 
 * Correct type, correct length, correct 
 *
